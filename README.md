 ## About
 
 This is some code I've written or edited from another project on federated learning. Myself and the original author are working on a subset of the author's original problem as a small research project.

 Some additional helper files have been included.
 
 ## To run
 
 From the terminal enter <code>py .\s2kew_fl_kfold2.py --model custom_EN_b0_v3</code>
